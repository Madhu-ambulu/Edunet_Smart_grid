🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit

Pandas

NumPy

Plotly

OpenWeatherMap API

--------

🔄 Workflow

Data is loaded from Excel

Weather is fetched via API

Demand is predicted

Best energy source is recommended

Battery charge/discharge logic calculated

Visual charts displayed in dashboard

--------

📡 Weather API

The app fetches live:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind speed

-------

Using OpenWeather API

🔑 Add your API key in app.py

------

🔮 Electricity Demand Prediction

Uses rule-based logic based on:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind speed

You can replace it with ML models if needed.

-----

🔌 Source Recommendation Logic Condition Recommended Source Temperature > 28°C Solar Wind > 4 m/s Wind Humidity > 75% Hydropower Else Thermal 🔋 Battery Storage Logic Condition Action Demand > High threshold Discharge Demand < Low threshold Charge In between Idle

Battery system helps reduce grid stress during high-load periods.

-------

📊 Visualizations

Included charts:

✅ Line chart – demand trend ✅ Bar chart ✅ Pie chart – source distribution ✅ Heatmap ✅ 7-day forecast chart ✅ Current weather panels

--------

⚡ Optimized Demand

⚙ The model uses predicted demand → compares with battery availability → computes optimized grid usage and energy savings.
